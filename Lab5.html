                <div id="flex-item1"><p> Oh BLTurtle, how I adore you, I know you aren't technically a BLT because theres no bacon but its to funny calling you a BLTurtle, so much so that only having lettuce and tomatoe is enough to call you such,, actually you do have a burger in that shell too so that can be the missing B, crisis averted... Come to think of it i don't think you are even a turtle, i think you are a tortoise considering you are a land animal not the sea creature with flippers that would make you a turtle...</p> </div>
                <div id= "flex-item2"> <p>  Despite not being a blt or a turtle you are still my BLTurtle and I love you for that and I have found ways to sneak you into everywhere i can whether that be in logo design projects or my personal dnd sessions, you are my constant source of happiness and knowing you exist makes everything a little more tolerable. I may not have created you but hey found family is a popular trope and just like a found family i found you and you hold a place in my mind and heart. </p> </div>
                <div id= "flex-item3"> <p> Some have expressed concern that you are squished in that shell underneath all the vegetables and meat but I like to think they are like blankets keeping you warm and cool accordingly and offering nice texture feelings so no matter where your little legs may take you, you will always be comfortable. Also tortoises i do not have very large torsoes under their shells so it is entirely plausible you have all the space you need under the decor or food. Upon research that would be very bad for the BLTurtle and probably be very uncomfortable and unhealthy.. Ignoring that fact so I can still enjoy the BLTurtle for the icon that it is I think it is great that it has the cosmetic addition of a lettuce tomato and cheese burger inside its shell and I hope its out there living its best life.. despite the fact i know its not real. </p> </div>
